# DAY 1

`OPENING SEQUENCE`  
`SETTING: Black Screen`  

##### -> Whew! I’m finally done moving into my new apartment downtown!  
##### -> The weather is so nice today, I should check out some of the hot spots in the area.  
##### -> My neighbors told me about a popular coffee shop not too far from here, so maybe I should start there.  
#
`FIRST ENCOUNTER`  
`SETTING: Coffee Shop- Inside & Outside, Daytime`  

##### -> Here it is. It really isn’t that far.  
##### -> Huh? Why are there so many customers at this time of day?! I guess my neighbors weren’t kidding about this place being super popular.  
##### -> Well, it’s time to see what all the hype is about.

*`Scene change from outside shop to inside shop`*
*`Insert ring sound to note walking into coffee shop`*  
##### -> Oh, wow. There are quite a lot of customers around the register right now. Hopefully this doesn’t take too long…
Unknown voice (but it is A): “Alright, that will be out shortly for you, miss! So, what would you like to order, sir?”  
##### -> Is that the barista I’m hearing?  

*`Insert CG of Ajax smiling and taking customers orders`*  
Ajax: “Ok, got it! We’ll call your name when it’s ready.”  
Ajax: “Welcome! What would you like to order today?”  
Customer 1: “I’ll take a v-vanilla latte”  
Ajax: “Alrightie, and will that be all for today?”  
Customer 1: “Y-yes, t-thank you.”  
Ajax: “Why, of course!”  
Customer 2: “GWAH! He is SOOO cute!”  
Customer 3: “Right?! I should totally ask for his number”  
Customer 4: “His smile is sweeter than my drink! And his eyes?! Those dreamy eyes…”  
Customer 5: “Oh. My. God. He’s looking over towards me!!”  
*`End Of CG`*  

##### -> Wow, it seems like this barista is a hit with the customers. I’d hate to go up against him in a popularity contest that’s for sure.  
Ajax: “Next in line please.”  
##### -> Finally, looks like it’s my turn to order.  
Ajax: “Hi there! Welcome to Celestia Cafe. My name is Ajax and I’ll be taking your order today. I don’t think I’ve seen your face in here before. Is this your first visit?  

`OPTION SCREEN:`  
  - Yeah, it is! I actually just moved in nearby, and my neighbors highly recommended this place. E3 +3 E2 +1  
  - Uh, yeah. Can I order now? E1 +3E2 +1  
  - It is my first time. I heard this place was pretty popular, and now I see what draws in the crowd~ E4 +3 E2 +1E1 +1  


`RESPONSES FROM AJAX:`  
  - Seems like you’ve got some trustworthy neighbors. I hope we don’t disappoint~  
  - Uh, yeah. Sure.  
  - Ahha, well it doesn’t hurt that our coffee is pretty good too. Hope I don’t disappoint”  
  Ajax: So, what would you like to order today?”  


`OPTION SCREEN:`   
  - Coffee. Black. E1 +3 E4 +1 E2 +1  
  - Can I get a matcha latte with oat milk and whipped cream on top. E3 +3E2 +1  
  - I take a medium caramel cold brew. E4 +3E3 +1  
  - Yeah, I’ll take an energy drink. E2 +3E1 +1  


`RESPONSES FROM AJAX:`   
  - Keeping it simple. Okay, coming right up.  
  - Of course you would…Great! That will be out shortly.  
  - You got good taste. This is my go to order as well. I’ll get this out to you shortly.  
  - Uhhhhh, okay. Sure…  

“Great! Thank you.”  

`RESPONSES FROM YOU:`  
  - N/A  
  - I thought I heard him mumble something after I ordered…Hmm maybe I just imagined it.  
  - Ooo looks like he has similar tastes to me~  
  - Why did he look so confused? It was a pretty simple order.  
  
##### -> Anyway, with a barista like Ajax working I can see why this place stays busy. All the customers are fawning over him.  
##### -> He did seem like a friendly guy, and his face was quite handsome I must admit.  
##### -> God, I’m going to turn into one of those gawking customers before I know it…  
##### -> Looks like my order is ready.  

Ajax: Hope you enjoy your drink~! Come back anytime!”  
“Thank you.”  

##### -> Oh my god, I think he just winked at me. This guy is pretty good. I haven’t even tried the drink yet and I’m already thinking about my next visit.  
##### -> Sigh… What I would give to have a boyfriend like him to show me around town, make me nice drinks everyday, and smile at me with that gorgeous face…  
##### -> I need to get these fantasies out of my mind before I lose it. Time to just sit, relax, and enjoy my drink.  

Customer 2: “OMG! He is SOOO cool!”  
Customer 3: “Of course he would drive a motorcycle. Take me with you~”  
Customer 4: “A dreamy smile with the bad boy image of him on a motorcycle? Can he get any hotter?!”  
Customer 5: “Oh. My. God. I think he looked over at me. I’m gonna faint~”  

##### -> Hmm? What are those customers talking about?  
*`Insert motorcycle rev noise`*  
##### -> Outside, on that motorcycle, is that…Ajax?  
##### -> Woah. I didn’t take him for the type of person to drive a motorcycle. I gotta agree with those other customers, it does up his appeal.  
##### -> And his motorcycle itself… Seems custom designed with all those intricate water details.  
##### -> If only I was on there with him, holding him tight as he sped off… Guess I’m sticking to dreaming for now.  
##### -> Enough daydreaming about the cute barista! I need to finish this delicious drink and get to exploring what else this city has to offer.  
##### -> And damn, this drink is pretty good. Must be some shop secret to get that deep flavor. Paired with the allure of Ajax, I see why my neighbors recommended this place first.   
##### -> Anyway, down the hatch!  
*`Gulp sound`*  
##### -> I hope this isn’t the only place with a super cute employee. Time to explore!  
#
`THE DISCOVERY`  
`SETTING: Sketchy Area, Nighttime`  
*`Scene shift to open city at night`*  
##### -> Whew. It has been a looong day of looking around, but not any person out there looking as handsome as Ajax.  
##### -> Wow, a whole day of exploring, and I’m still hung up on the first dude I saw… I’m hopeless.  
##### -> I need to get him out of my mind and get home.  
##### -> And then maybe I’ll see him again tomorrow when I visit the shop, hehe.  
##### -> Hmmm, wait. That motorcycle over there… no way. It’s totally Ajax’s! It has the same water designs on it, and I doubt there is a store just pumping out motorcycles that unique.  
##### -> But what is it doing all the way out here? This area seems pretty isolated. Part of the reason I was going to leave was because I felt like I hit a deadend of stuff to explore, but I guess the universe had one last place for me to visit, hehe.  
##### -> It’s not like I’m stalking him either. I just happened to see his bike here. A-and what if he’s hurt? I really should just check it out to see if he’s okay, of course.  
*`Walking over sound`*  
##### -> There are lights on in the building it’s parked in front of, and it sounds like some people are talking in there.  
##### -> I know I probably shouldn’t, but the urge to look inside is so strong.  
##### -> Oh! I could totally see what’s going on inside if I look through that window up there…  
##### -> I shouldn’t… I should just head home and mind my own business.  
##### -> Unless…  

`OPTION SCREEN:`  
  - Look through the window  
  - Go home GAME OVER  

`RESPONSES:`  
  - Hmmm OK! I’m gonna do it. The curiosity is too great.  
  - Ugh, I probably shouldn’t go digging into the private life of a man I met literal hours ago. Home it is. `GAME OVER`  

##### -> Just as I was turning around to go home, Ajax walked out of the building.  
Ajax: “Oh? It’s the new customer. What are you doing here?”  
##### -> Uh oh, his smiley appearance from earlier is gone.  
“I-I was just out exploring the city since I’m new.”  
Ajax: “Uh huh…”  
##### -> Gotta change the topic fast or I won’t sound reliable.  
“Uh-Uh I really like your motorcycle by the way.”  
Ajax: “How did you know it was mine?”  
“Oh, well I saw you on it earlier, and it’s not hard to miss–”  
Ajax: “Are you fucking stalking me?”  
“What? N-No, of course not! Like I said, I was just exploring.”  
Ajax: “Wow and here I thought you were kind of cute, but you’re just a creep. Get out of here stalker before I call the authorities.”  
“B-But I–”  
Ajax: “Now!”  
##### -> I’m too stunned to even respond, but I turn away and continue heading home. Looks like I won’t be going to the coffee shop any more…  

##### -> Time to climb~  
*`Rustling sounds`*  
##### -> Whew! Okay, I’m in position, and I was right! The view from here is perfect. Now let’s see…  
##### -> There! I see Ajax! Looks like he’s with two other people. Time to listen in~  
Random 1: “Are you sure about this recipe, Ajax?”  
Ajax: “Relax, OK? This is totally it. I work there after all, I’d be able to tell the difference. Besides, we already started producing. It’s too late to start over now.”  
Random 1: “You’re right. I’m just anxious for this to go well.”  
Random 2: “We all are. If this goes as planned, we’ll each be loaded in no time!”  
Ajax: “Exactly. Which is why I triple checked to make sure we got the right recipe.”  
Random 1: “Oh hey! It looks like the first batch is done. Let’s check out its quality.”  
##### -> Interesting. Seems like they’re doing something to get rich quick. Something sketchy perhaps. Ajax is continuing to surprise me with each passing moment.  
##### -> And the fact this potentially illicit activity isn’t dissuading me from liking him…  
##### -> I-I should just try to focus on what he’s doing exactly. I’m sure it’s not that bad.  
##### -> Wait a second… this aroma. It smells like… coffee?! Are they making coffee here? Well that’s not sketchy at all.  
##### -> So, why does it still seem suspicious though? Ajax did mention something about a recipe. Perhaps it’s…  
##### -> I should keep listening to learn more.  

`OPTION SCREEN:`  
  - Head home GAME OVER  
  - Continue to listen  
  
`RESPONSES: ` 
  - I feel like I have eavesdropped for too long. I should just head home and preserve the crimeless image of Ajax in my head. GAME OVER  
    ##### -> Yeah, and I don’t want to get involved too deep in this. I should just leave…  
    ##### -> Wh– AAAHH!  
    *`As you go to leave you slip from your vantage point and fall`*  
    ##### -> Ow, ow, ow. I can’t move! The fall must’ve been too hard.  
    ##### -> Oh no… Ajax probably heard me… but my eyelids feel like lead.  
    ##### -> And I feel something warm on the back of my head…  
    ##### -> Is… is this it? What a pathetic way to go…  
    *`You died`*  

  - I have to keep listening. I feel like I’m on the cusp of learning what’s going on.  
    ##### -> Ok, looks like they’re back from testing the first batch.  
    Random 1: “Mmm~ You were totally right, Ajax! This tastes just like the shop’s!  
    Ajax: “See, I told you there was no need to worry. Now that we have this, that old man’s business doesn’t stand a chance.”  
    ##### -> I knew it! They stole the Celestia Cafe’s secret recipe. But what value does that have to them?  
    *`Clang sound`*  
    ##### -> Shit! I accidentally knocked something over. Please tell me they didn’t hear that.  
    Random 2: “Hey, did you guys hear that?”  
    ##### -> Great.  
    ##### -> I better skedaddle before I’m caught… but I do wanna know what they intend to do with the secret recipe.  

`OPTION SCREEN:`  
  - Leave immediately  
  - Continue to listen GAME OVER  

`RESPONSES:`  
  - Ugh, I shouldn’t risk it. I gotta leave. Now.  
  - Maybe they’ll think it was a stray cat. Or the wind. I gotta keep listening.  
    Random 1: “Maybe it was a stray cat?”  
    ##### -> Yes!  
    Random 2: “Or maybe it was the wind?”  
    ##### -> Yes! Yes!  
    Ajax: “Or something… or someone else. I’ll go check it out just to be safe.”  
    ##### -> Crap.  
    ##### -> I gotta bounce before he catches me.  
    Ajax: “Going somewhere?”  
    ##### -> He’s already outside?! Damn, he’s fast.  
    “I-it’s not what it looks like. I was just…admiring the glass work on this window!”  
    Ajax: “Likely story. But it doesn’t really matter what you were doing. You clearly saw what was going on inside.”  
    “Whaaaat? I totally did not see you guys making stolen coffee or anything.”  
    Ajax: “Sigh…You really did see too much. Damn. It’s a shame. I thought you were pretty cute.”  
    “C-cute?!”  
    Ajax: “But you gotta understand. We can’t have anyone finding out…”  
    *`Before you respond, Ajax pulls out a gun and points it at you`*  
    *`BANG`* `GAME OVER`  
    ~~Might change ending a little bit~~  

#  
*`You turn to leave in a hurry and head home`*  
*`Scene change to inside sketchy building`*  
Random 1: “Eh, maybe it was a stray, or even the wind.”  
Random 2: “You’re probably right.”  
Ajax: “Still. I think I’ll go check it out.”  

*`Rustling sounds and scene changes to outside building`*  
Ajax: “Hmm. I don’t see anyone. I suppose it really must’ve been the wind.  
Ajax: “Unless… what do we have here?”  
*`Insert picture of T holding keychain`*  
Ajax: “Looks like your owner accidentally left you behind. Leaving in a hurry most likely.”  
Ajax: “Well, newbie. You got some explaining to do.”  

*`Fade to Black`*

# DAY 2

`THE INTERROGATION`  
`SETTING: Black Screen`  

*`Wake up at home`*   
##### -> Wow… that was some crazy stuff I stumbled across yesterday. Well, stumbled on purpose, hehe.  
##### -> I really wonder if I understood the situation correctly. Did Ajax really steal the Celestia Cafe recipe? But why?  
##### -> I want to ask him directly, but we don’t know each other that well. And I kinda get the feeling he might do something…crazy.  
##### -> Still, I’m itching for answers. I should go to *coffee shop name* today and see if I can learn more about him. If he’s even working today that is. I hope he is…  
##### -> Snap out of it! He could be a criminal *insert name here*. I just really want coffee too. Yeah, that’s why.  
##### -> God, I’m hopeless…  

*`Transition to Coffee Shop Inside, Daytime`*  
##### -> Seeing as there are a lot of people here, I think it’s safe to assume he’s on shift.  
##### -> Why am I suddenly so nervous?! It’s okay, he doesn’t know anything. I’m cool, I’m good. I’m just here for coffee. I got this.  
Ajax: “Next!”  
*`Small gasp`*  
##### -> Oh god…it’s my turn. Suddenly my confidence is waning.  
*`You walk up to counter`*  
“H-hi, I’ll take a–”  
Ajax: “Oh! I know you! You’re that pretty customer from yesterday~”  
##### -> P-pretty?!  
Ajax: “I’d never forget a face like yours. So, I’m guessing you liked the coffee. Or perhaps something…or someone…else brought you back.”  
##### -> His words are making me drown in sweat. It sounds like he knows. I just need to remind myself he’s flirting.  
##### -> Wait. Flirting? With me?!  
*`You look up to meet his gaze, and he gives you a bright smile and quick wink`*  
##### -> OMG I’M GONNA LOSE IT.  
##### -> No! I got this. Come on, it’s time to get some info out of him. It’s time to flirt back.  
“Y-yeah the drinks are pretty good, but some…thing did capture my attention last time.  
T-The lighting! It’s great for photos! HAHA!  
##### -> I swung my phone around in a desperate attempt to hide my awkward body language.  
##### -> God, I couldn’t keep up, and I embarrassed myself…  
Ajax: “Haha…”  
##### -> Great. A sympathy laugh. Now I’ll never learn more because why would he talk to a freak like me?!  
Ajax: “Hey.”  
##### -> Eep!  
*`You look back at Ajax’s suddenly stoic face.`*  
##### -> What’s with the sudden mood shift?!  
Ajax: “Your phone… Is that a keychain on your phone?”  
“Huh? O-Oh, this thing? Yeah, I won a collector’s set at this convention a year ago. They’re pretty rare, so I pride myself on having them~”  
Ajax: “Pretty rare huh…”  
##### -> Crap. He probably thinks I’m a loser now. Note to self: don’t overshare embarrassing details to the cute barista boy who is potentially a criminal.  
Ajax: “So.”  
##### -> Oh! His response knocks me out of my self-rambling state.”  
Ajax: “Your order?”  
##### -> Dang, what’s with the curt question? I must’ve really blown my chance…  
“Y-yeah, I’ll get…”  

`OPTION SCREEN:`  
  - Chai Tea Latte E4 +3E3 +1  
  - Caramel Macchiato E1 +3E2 +1  
  - Iced Green Tea E3 +3E1 +1  
  - Osmanthus Wine E2 +3E3 +1E4 +1  

Ajax: “Coming right up.”  
##### -> No smile? No flirty response? Sigh… Guess I’ll never know what was going on in that building last night.  
*`You find a place to sit and pout about your failure to get on his good side`*  
Ajax: “Here’s your drink~”  
“O-Oh! Thank you so much!”  
##### -> He brought it out to me… And he’s smiling brightly at me now.  
Ajax: “Hey, can I ask you a question?  
“S-Sure.”  
##### -> He leans in closer to my ear and I have to force down a tiny shriek from his sudden proximity.  
Ajax: “So, my shift is ending soon, and I was wondering–if you don’t mind of course–if you would like to get to know each other a little better. I guess what I’m saying is…if you would like to go on a date with me?  
##### -> A DATE?!  
##### -> I thought I blew my chances, but here he is offering the best option I could only hope for.  
##### -> This is my chance to get more info out of him, and I guess the date aspect would be a bonus.  
##### -> A huge bonus.  
##### -> Now, to choose my words wisely, and try not to mess this up.  

`OPTION SCREEN:`   
  - OMG YES PLEASE! You are SOOOO hot. E4 +3E3 +1E1 +1  
  - Uhh, I don’t really know you, so no? E1 +3E2 +1  
  - U-Um *blushes* S-Sure, hehe. E3 +3E4 +1  
  - Okay. E2 +3E1 +1  

Ajax: “Fantastic! I end in around 30 minutes, wanna meet outside by my bike then?”  
“Sounds like a plan.”  
Ajax: “Great! I’ll see you then~”  
##### -> Still in a slight state of shock, I watch Ajax walk back to the counter with a smile on his face.  
Customer 2: “Did you guys see that?!?!”  
Customer 3: “Yeah, what the hell? He got all close to someone who looks like that?!”  
Customer 4: “You don’t suppose they’re dating, do you?”  
Customer 5: “As if! He was probably politely telling them they had a booger in their nose or something.”  
*`The sound of customers’ giggling plays`*  
##### -> Harsh much? They know I can hear them, right?  
##### -> On second thought, they definitely know.  
##### -> Sigh… Looks like I didn’t take into account the repercussions outside of Ajax finding out I know what he’s up to.  
##### -> But I can handle some clique-y self-proclaimed fans.  
*`Customers’ Giggling continues`*  
##### -> At least I hope I can…  
##### -> Just ignore them *insert name here*, and enjoy the drink personally delivered by Ajax.  
*`Sipping sound`*  
##### -> Damn. I know it’s only the second time I’ve had a drink here, but this is really good. Maybe I can kinda understand why Ajax would steal the recipe.  
*`Screen slowly flashes black for a moment`*  
##### -> Okay, Ajax should be getting off around now. I should go wait by his motorcycle. Time to psych myself up and try not to make a fool of myself!  

*`Scene transitions to Outside Coffee Shop, Daytime`*  
Ajax: “Hey! There you are~”  
##### -> Ajax walks toward me with a jovial smile.  
“H-Hi!”  
Ajax: “You knew which bike was mine?”  
##### -> Great, I didn’t want him to have to wait for me, but now I seem like a stalker.  
“Yeah, I saw you drive off yesterday. These designs are too unique to forget.”  
Ajax: “Haha, thank you. I got the designs custom made. Anyway, I was thinking I could drive us somewhere nice, and we could start with some good old-fashioned conversation?”  
##### -> His words oozed with charm, it was hard to not think all his ideas were perfect.  
“I would love that.”  
Ajax: “Perfect. Hop on.”  
##### -> His smile seemed to have a devilish appearance for a second. I think I’m imagining things. It’s just first date jitters.  
##### -> I hop onto his motorcycle and dawn his extra helmet.  
Ajax: “Hold on tight, okay?”  
##### -> As he said that he guided my arms around his waist.  
“O-Okay.”  
##### -> With that, Ajax revs his engine and takes off down the street. I embrace him tightly and take in the sweet smell of coffee on him…  

*`Scene shift to Black`*  
##### -> Mesmerized by my situation, I barely register that we’re slowing down. Ajax eventually stops, and snaps me out of my daze.  
Ajax: “We’re here.”  
##### -> I hop off the motorcycle and remove my helmet to find myself…in front of the building from last night?!  

*`Scene shifts to Sketchy City, Nighttime`*  
##### -> Crap! Does this mean he knows I was here? But how??  
##### -> No. I shouldn’t jump to conclusions. Maybe he just took me here because he’s obviously familiar with the spot. Yeah that’s probably it.  
Ajax: “So…”  
Ajax: “Did you want to tell me what you were doing here last night? Or will I have to force it out of you?”  
##### -> Shit. He knows. But how?! Ugh, there's no point trying to dwell on that now. Right now, I need to throw him off my trail. Time to feign ignorance.  
“W-What’re you talking about? I don’t think I’ve been to this part of town yet. After all, I did just move here.”  
##### -> Perfect, I will play the part of a newbie to town. It’s not like I’m totally lying. I’ve never even been here in the daytime before. The place barely looks familiar.  
##### -> Just as I was gathering my confidence, Ajax pulls out a keychain that looks awfully similar to the one I normally keep on my bag.  
##### -> Damn. That’s why his mood shifted when he saw the one on my phone!  
Ajax: “Judging by the look on your face, I’ve guessed correctly. You really should be more careful with such rare collector’s edition items.”  
##### -> Normally him remembering that fact would give me butterflies in my stomach, but he’s trapped me in a corner…  
Ajax: “So, what I would like to know is what you were doing here last night. Oh, and pick your words carefully, OK?”  
##### -> His words were a deadly mix of charm and malice. I really do need to be careful with what I say…  

`OPTION SCREEN:`  
  - I followed you from the shop. I-I thought you were cute, and I just wanted to get to know you better. E3 +3E2 +1E4 +1  
  - I was out exploring the city yesterday, and found myself here. I did see your motorcycle here, but I just assumed you lived here. E2 +3E1 +1  
  - What were you doing here last night? Jeez, mind your own business, pal. E1 +3E2 +1  
Ajax: “Hmmm, is that so?”  
##### -> Ajax steps closer to me and I stumble backwards against a wall as he slams his hand next to me.  

*`Scene shifts to CG of kabedon`*  
Ajax: “Hey, *insert name*, hold still…”  
##### -> I avert my gaze as his words seduce me.  
Ajax: “Something tells me you’re not telling me the whole story.”  
##### -> H-He’s so close. His warm breath tickles my ear. And that same intoxicating smell of coffee overwhelms my senses.  
“I-I may have lingered around here f-for a moment.”  
Ajax: “Mhmm, and?”  
“A-and I may have heard some people in a building nearby.”  
Ajax: “Come on now, I know you did a lot more than hear…”  
##### -> He’s dangerously close now. If I turned to face him, I would hit his face.  
“I-I… M-Maybe I-I…”  
##### -> Ajax lets out a soft chuckle as he basically puts his mouth against my ear.  
Ajax: “Looks like I’ve got a problem then. A very cute problem.”  
##### -> I feel my face erupt with heat. Despite leaning against a wall, I feel like my knees will give out.  

#
`KISS EVENT <3 `  
`SETTING: Still in CG of kabedon`  
##### -> Suddenly, I feel the soft sensation of Ajax’s hand under my chin. He gently turns my head to face him.  
##### -> My eyes are squeezed shut, but I can feel his gaze piercing me deeply.  
Ajax: “Look at me.”  
##### -> I’m afraid of how my body will react if I make eye contact with him. I can’t open my eyes. I can’t let him get to me.  
Ajax: “Open.”  
##### -> A simple command, but it felt more like a compelling plea. Like he wanted me to, more for my sake than his.  
Ajax: “For me.”  
##### -> The final hit to my fading mental fortitude. I can’t help but fulfill his request.  
##### -> I slowly open my eyes to find a pair of piercing blue eyes staring longingly into mine.  
Ajax: “Good…there…you go…”  
##### -> His words come out slowly as his face inches closer to mine with each one he utters until…  
##### -> His lips softly graze mine, and I let out a soft moan.  
##### -> Ajax backs up enough for me to barely make out his blurry visage before placing his lips back on mine.  
##### -> This time his kiss is much deeper. Much more passionate as he presses his body against mine.  
##### -> I lose all track of time, all train of thought.  
##### -> Too soon, he pulls back, taking his sweet lips with him.  
##### -> My breathing is shaky and he looks at me with the smug smile of victory.  
Ajax: “Now… Do you want to tell me the rest of your little adventure from last night?”  
##### -> My head feels like it’s about to explode…I don’t think I can keep up my defenses any longer.  
“F-Fine. I’ll tell you…”  
Ajax: “Oh?”  
*`End of CG`*  

##### -> I proceed to tell him about how I watched and listened in from the window, and that I know what they are doing. Or at least could guess what they were doing anyway.  
Ajax: “Hmmm. As I expected…This isn’t good for me, but maybe I can…”  
##### -> Ajax starts muttering something to himself. Maybe I can use this moment to slip away?  
##### -> I’m about to make a sly step away when Ajax blurts out…  
Ajax: “I’ve got a proposition for you.”  
“A proposition?”  
Ajax: “Yes. You got spunk and a good head on your shoulders. Not to mention you’re cute. I like you, so how would you to be in on it?”  
##### -> H-Huh?! He said so many things at once my mind is spinning.  
##### -> …C-Cute…  
“In on what?”  
Ajax: “Don’t play coy now~ In on my little operation here. We could use someone like you. You can even get a cut.”  
“You want me to help you? But we barely know each other. We literally met yesterday.”  
Ajax: “Maybe that’s part of the appeal, but I’m drawn to you. I just know this is the right move. So, what do you say? You want in?”  
##### -> This man is more crazy than I thought. But also even more charming.  
##### -> Gah! What should I say to him?  

`OPTION SCREEN:`   
  - No *`GAME OVER`*  
  - Yes  

Ajax: “Oh, ok. I get it, haha.”  
##### -> He walked back to the counter with a new solemn expression.  
##### -> Aw, I feel bad, but I don’t want to accidentally let him know what I saw yesterday.  
##### -> Oh god he’s staring daggers into me. Maybe I should make this drink to go…  

*`You go outside the shop and decide to go for a walk SCENE SHIFT to outside coffee shop`*  
##### -> At least it’s a nice day for a walk. Let’s try to not think about hurting Ajax’s feelings.  
Unknown voice: “Help me! Someone help me please!”  
##### -> What was that? Is someone in trouble?! I should go check it out.  
##### -> It seemed like it was coming from this alleyway. It’s a little creepy… No, I need to help whoever is calling out.  
##### -> I walk down the alley and meekly call out.  
“H-Hello? Is anyone there? I heard a call for help.”  
##### -> Seems like no one is here. This is weird, I could’ve sworn I heard–  
*`WHACK, THUD`*  
##### -> Suddenly, I’m laying on the ground and my head is throbbing.  
“Wha…What happened…?  
Ajax: “Sorry, but I know you were there yesterday. I can’t have anyone ratting out my plans, so I hope you understand.”  
##### -> A-Ajax? What is he saying, does he know I was there yesterday? I want to ask, but he raises a bat and swings it down.  
##### -> Everything went black…  
Ajax: “Woah, I didn’t expect you to agree!”  
“T-Then why’d you even ask me?!”  
Ajax: “No, no. This is great, don’t worry! This was the safe choice to make. Come on, I’ll show you around inside.”  
“O-Ok”  
##### -> Something tells me that option wasn’t much of a choice…  

*`Screen shifts to black`*  
##### -> Ajax leads me inside the building  

*`Screen shifts to inside sketchy building, daytime`*  
##### -> Immediately, I’m hit with an overwhelming aroma of coffee.  
“That sure is a lot of coffee.”  
Ajax: “Great, isn’t it!”  
Ajax: “Like you have probably theorized, this coffee was made using the recipe from Celestia Cafe.  
“About that, I understand the drinks there are pretty good, but why copy the recipe?  
Ajax: “Glad you asked. The owner’s an asshat. He’s done a lot of bad shit, and to top it off he barely pays us employees. He thinks that with his secret recipe no other coffee shop stands a chance, so he can act however he pleases.  
“That’s horrible. So, you want to give him a proper rival in this war of coffee shops?”  
Ajax: “Exactly. Without his special coffee just for his own shop, and without me of course, his business is gonna crumble.”  
“I think your absence will be the final straw. You got quite a following, you know?  
Ajax: “Haha. Can I count you among them then?  
“I was hoping I’d be a little higher on the totem pole.”  
Ajax: “Mhmm. I like the way you think. I knew bringing you on was a good idea.”  
##### -> I can’t help but blush at Ajax’s compliment.  
Ajax: “So, the big day for us is two days away. That’s when we are setting up shop and opening. Tomorrow night we move the merchandise. Can I count on you to be there?”
“Of course.”  
Ajax: “Perfect. After that, hopefully it’s smooth sailing. Oh, and of course you’ll have a spot open to work at the shop. Right next to me~”
##### -> A smooth talker as always. But who could say no to him?  
“I couldn’t think of any other way I’d want it.”  
Ajax: “I’m glad. Well, that concludes the tour. Come on, I’ll drive you home.”  

*`Screen shifts to black`*  
##### -> Ajax drove me home and took off with a wave. My mind is reeling from all that has happened today, but one thing is certain: I’m in love with Ajax.  
##### -> He can definitely count on me! I won’t let him down!  

# DAY 3
`THE FATEFUL NIGHT`  
`SETTING: Black Screen to Sketchy Building`  
*`Screen slow flash back to black`*  

##### -> It’s been such a long day waiting to help Ajax. I’ve been so anxious all day, I can’t sit still. I was hoping to see him at the shop, but he wasn’t working.  
##### -> But it’s finally time to go over to the building and help.  

*`Screen shifts to sketchy building`*  
Ajax: “Hey, you came!”  
##### -> Ajax rushes over to me and embraces me tightly. He smells like freshly roasted coffee.  
“O-Of course I came. I’m all in, remember?”  
Ajax: “Right, right. How could I forget~”  
Ajax: “My friends are at the new place right now with most of the merchandise. We just need to pack up the rest and join up with them.”  
“Sounds like a plan!”  
Ajax: “Alright, let’s get a move on.”  
##### -> We start hauling the bags of coffee into a truck. After some time, we finally finish up.  
“Is that the last of it?”  
Ajax: “Yup. Let’s take this over to the new place. Hop in.”  
##### -> Just as we are about to get in the truck, we hear a shout.  
Unknown voice: “NOT SO FAST!”  
##### -> We whip around to see an old man with a crazy look in his eye. He’s obviously very agitated.  
Ajax: “The owner…”  
##### -> Ajax whispers. That crazy old dude is the owner of Celestia Cafe? The man does seems hellbent on stopping us, so it makes sense.  
“What should we do?”  
##### -> I whisper back to Ajax.  
Ajax: “I think I’ll take a page from your book of playing oblivious.”  
##### -> He gives me a quick wink and takes a few steps toward the owner.  
Ajax: “What are you doing here, old man? Business slow since I quit?  
##### -> So that’s why I didn’t see him today…  
Ajax: “Still, doesn’t mean you should beg me to come back. Not a very good look for you.”  
Owner: “Cut the shit, pretty boy! You don’t think I know what you’re up to here in your silly little factory?! You took my recipe. I know it! Neither of you are going anywhere until I search this place.”  
Ajax: “There’s no recipe here, old man. This is my place and you’re not searching shit.”  
Owner: “Think I don’t know the smell of my own recipe, boy?! Quit the act! You can’t fool me, you thief!”  
Ajax: “Tch.”  
##### -> Oh no, this old man isn’t buying it. I think it’s time I step in…  
“With all due respect sir, you can’t search this place without a warrant.”  
Owner: “You stay out of this, you little vermin!”  
Ajax: “Hey! Don't talk to them like that!”  
Owner: “Aww, now isn’t this sweet. Young love. Why don’t you spare yourself the trouble and abandon this low life while you still can.”  
“How dare you! Ajax is an amazing person! You’re the low life here! Trying to intimidate two young adults and forcefully search this place without a warrant!”  
Owner: “Oh, I’ll show you my warrant…”  
##### -> The owner pulls out a gun and points it at me.  
Owner: “Does this suffice?”  
##### -> I swallow hard, and I’m paralyzed in fear.  
Owner: “Perhaps removing you from the equation will make the pretty boy here more cooperative.”  
Ajax: “No, don’t!”  
##### -> Ajax pulls out a gun as well and rushes in front of me.  
Owner: “Enough of these games!”  
##### -> The owner cocks the gun, and I squeeze my eyes shut.  
*`BANG`*  
##### -> A gunshot rings out…  

# ENDINGS

`ENDING 1`  
##### -> I finally manage to slowly force my eyes to open.  
##### -> But as soon as I opened them, I wished they were closed again.  
“NO!”  
##### -> I fall to the floor beside Ajax who is lying motionless in front of me.  
Owner: “Served him right! Now, there can be no witnesses…”  
##### -> Blinded by my rage, I spot the gun Ajax had tried to use to protect me.  
##### -> My body moves before my mind does. I pick up the gun, aim it at the owner, and pull the trigger.  
*`BANG`*  
##### -> I barely register the owner falling over as I return my focus to Ajax.  

*`Scene shift to CG of Ajax dying on floor`*  
“Come on, Ajax. Come on. Open your eyes!’  
##### -> My words are choked down by my sobs, and I caress Ajax’s cheek, silently pleading.  
*`cough, cough`*  
##### -> Ajax weakly coughs as his eyes partially open to face me. His blue irises are as striking as ever.  
“Yes, yes! That’s it, open your eyes!”  
##### -> I don’t know if he can even understand me through my cries.  
Ajax: “I-I’m…”  
“Shh, shh. It’s okay. Don’t speak. Save your strength.”  
Ajax: “I’m…I’m glad I met…you…”  
##### -> He gives me a weak smile before his eyes close once more, and his body goes limp.  
“No, no, no, no, NOOOOO!”  
##### -> My wailing echoes throughout the empty building as I hear sirens close in in the distance.  

*Could do this one with T and owner dying at same time, owner fleeing instead of being killed, or T weakly killing the owner as he threatens to kill mc  
#
`Alt ENDING 1`  
##### -> I finally manage to slowly force my eyes to open.  
##### -> But as soon as I opened them, I wished they were closed again.  
“NO!”  
##### -> I fall to the floor beside Ajax who is lying motionless in front of me.  
##### -> Across the building I see the owner in a similar state.  
##### -> Returning my focus to Ajax, I plead for him to open his eyes.  
“Come on, Ajax! Please, open your eyes! Please!!”  
##### -> My words are choked down by my sobs, and I caress Ajax’s cheek still silently begging.  
*`Cough, Cough`*  

*`Scene shifts to CG of Ajax dying on floor`*  
##### -> Ajax weakly coughs as his eyes partially open to face me. His blue irises are as striking as ever.  
Ajax: “Looks like… it was a draw…”  
“Shh shh. Don’t speak. Save your strength. And you won because you’re going to be just fine, OK?”   
Ajax: “I’m… I’m glad I met…you…”  
##### -> He gives me a weak smile as his eyes begin to close again, and his body goes limp.  
“No, no, no, NOOOO!”  
“Open your eyes, Ajax. Come on!! Please, you have to stay with me!”  
##### -> My tears are flowing out of my face as I cry to him, but there is no response.  
##### -> As if my mind has finally understood what has happened, I let out an echoing cry.  
##### -> Ajax…he’s…gone…  
#
`ENDING 2`  
##### -> I open my eyes slowly. My ears are ringing. My shoulders and arms are sore from moving all the coffee. My legs and feet are begging for a rest from standing for so long.   
##### -> And my stomach. My stomach…feels…warm?   
##### -> I slowly look down at my stomach, and I see a dark stain growing on my clothes. I gingerly hold the spot and bring my hand up to my face.  
##### -> It’s…covered in blood.  
##### -> My body finally reacts to the feeling and I collapse.  
Ajax: “No!”  
##### -> Ajax catches me before I fully fall on the ground.  
*`Scene change to CG of Ajax looking down, crying over MC`*  
Ajax: “No, no, no! This wasn’t supposed to happen. It should’ve been me!”  
##### -> How…how did this…happen?  
##### -> I feel something small and warm touch my face. Another. And another.  
##### -> I slowly look up to see Ajax’s crying face above me.  
##### -> Why…why is he…crying?  
##### -> Shh. No, no. Don’t cry.  
##### -> I strain my hand up to his face and wipe a tear from his cheek. He opens his eyes at my touch, and he places his hand against mine.  
Ajax: “Please…please. Don’t leave me”  
##### -> His voice sounds so…sad.  
“I’m glad I met…you…”  
##### -> I try to say more, but the words don’t come out.  
##### -> I hear him continue to cry, and I want to wipe more of his tears away, but…  
##### -> I feel…so tired…  
##### -> I think…I’ll just…rest…my eyes…for a…moment…  

#
`ENDING 3&4`  
##### -> I hear a loud thud hit the ground. Like a person falling over.  
##### -> Worried about Ajax, I force my eyes open and see…  
##### -> The owner, lying face first on the floor.  
Ajax: “Are you alright?”  
##### -> Ajax’s question knocks me out of my initial shock, and I quickly embrace him in a tight hug.  
“Y-Yeah. Thanks to you. Are you okay?”  
##### -> He squeezes me back a little tighter.  
Ajax: “Yes. I’m so glad you’re okay. I don’t know what I’d do if…if you…”  
##### -> He doesn’t finish his sentence, but I know what he means. I don’t know what I’d do without him either.  
##### -> Still embracing, I hear him breathe in deeply.  
Ajax: “You smell like coffee.”  
##### -> I let out a small laugh, and he pulls back enough from our hug to look me in the eyes.  
Ajax: “You mean the world to me.”  
##### -> His eyes dart back and forth between my own before he steadies his gaze a little lower, onto my lips.  
##### -> He leans slightly closer, and stops to look into my eyes again as if looking for approval.  
##### -> I close my own eyes in response, lightly purse my lips, and lean closer as well.  
##### -> Ajax closes the space between us, and I feel his tender lips on mine. Slowly but surely our kiss develops into a passionate one.  
##### -> Everything around us seems to fade into the background, and it’s just him and I. In this moment. Together.  

#
*`ENDING 3`*  
##### -> Eventually, we break our lips apart from one another, and I stare deeply into Ajax’s deep blue eyes.  
Ajax: “I’d do anything for you.”   
##### -> He caresses my left cheek. I hold his hand there.  
“Me too.”  
Ajax: “After what just happened, I’d better take you home personally.”  
“But what about the merchandise?”  
Ajax: “I’ll come back later to deal with it. For now, I need to be sure that you get home, safe and sound.”  
“O-Ok, if you say so…”  
*`Rev sound`*  

*`Insert CG of riding on motorcycle with Ajax`*  
##### -> I hop on the back of Ajax’s motorcycle, and he takes off towards my place.  
Ajax: “You know…I just gotta say, you moving here and us meeting…was the miracle I didn’t know I needed.”  
##### -> I squeeze my arms around him tighter.  
Ajax: “The moment I saw you enter Celestia Cafe I knew you were something else, someone special. And I just knew I had to see that special up close.”  
“And I knew right away that I would be enraptured by you. Your smile alone holds enough charm to sway a whole town to your liking.”  
Ajax: “Haha, so you're a sucker for my smile? Good to know, good to know.”  
##### -> I can’t see his face, but I can hear the smug smirk on it.  
“Yeah, I guess you can say that~”  
##### -> After some more driving in silence, Ajax speaks up again.  
Ajax: “Hey, so I know we have been through a lot together in the past couple days, and it’s probably obvious at this point–at least I hope it is–but I was just wondering if we could, you know? Make it official?”  
##### -> For a guy so naturally charming, it was nice to hear him speak so nervously.  
##### -> Time for a little teasing~  
“Hmm, I’ll have to think about it.”  
Ajax: “O-Oh, I just thought that… Uh, yeah that’s okay. Just lemme know, I guess. No pressure.”  
“Aaaand done thinking about it. Of course I want to be with you, Ajax.”  
Ajax: “You were teasing me just now, weren’t you?”  
“Maybe~”  
Ajax: “Punishment time~”  
##### -> Ajax proceeds to do a wheelie and speed off even faster towards my place.  
##### -> With a new sense of thrill and adrenaline pumping through me, I hold onto Ajax’s–my boyfriend’s–waist even tighter.  

#
`ENDING 4`  
*`Follows right after ending 3`*  
##### -> After what feels like an eternity of bliss, Ajax breaks our kiss, but still keeps his face close to mine.  
Ajax: “We should probably drop off the rest of the merchandise before the others start to worry.”  
“You’re right. As much as I want to stay in this moment, we should probably get going.”  
##### -> Ajax gives me a smile in response as we head to the truck and take off to the new shop.  
*`Vroom sounds and fade to black and then coffee shop`*  
Ajax: “Welcome to Tartelette Roasting Company! Why don't you take a look around while my friends and I unload.”  
##### -> Ajax calls over his friends, and they start unloading as I begin my look around.  
##### -> The shop is way nicer than Celestia Cafe. There are similar water designs from Ajax’s motorcycle around the place giving it a unique aesthetic.   
##### -> Yet, despite its uniqueness, the shop exudes a sense of home. I have no doubt that the people are going to love it here.  
Ajax: “So, what do you think?”  
“It’s amazing! This place screams success. And with you working here…well that guarantees it.”  
Ajax: “Haha, well I know I’ll be full of motivation each day with you around~”  
##### -> My face quickly heats up.  
Ajax: “We’re done setting up for the night. Come on, I’ll take you home. You gotta be well rested for the grand opening tomorrow.”  

*`Rev sound and Scene shifts to black`*  
##### -> With that, we take off, and Ajax drops me off at my place. He places a quick peck on my cheek and flashes me a wink before taking off.  
##### -> So, this is what it’s like to have a boyfriend. Not bad, not bad at all.  
##### -> With all that has happened today, my body appreciates the rest, and I quickly fall asleep…  

*`Slow flash and back to black`*  

# DAY 4  

##### -> What a surprisingly refreshing night's sleep! I guess my body knew that today was an important day and gave me just what I needed.  
##### -> The shop will be opening soon, I should get there before then.  
##### -> I quickly get ready and head to the shop.  

*`Scene shift to outside coffee shop`*  
##### -> Oh, wow! There are already quite a lot of customers lined up outside. I guess word spread of this place opening quickly. And I’m sure news of Ajax working here helped bring in these people as well.  
##### -> I head towards the door of the shop when some voices stop me.  
Customer 2: “Um, excuuuuse you! You can’t just cut the line!”  
Customer 3: “Yeah! Head to the back of the line, or better yet, just go home.”   
Customer 4: “Haha, yeah! Your face will, like, totally ruin the vibe of the opening.”  
Customer 5: “Agreed. And we can’t have Ajax’s big day ruined by you!”  
##### -> Before I could even reply to their snide comments, Ajax opened the door.  
Ajax: “Great, you’re here!”   
Customers collectively: “OMG!!! Hi Ajax~”  
Ajax: “Hi, everyone! Thank you all for coming here for *shop name*’s grand opening. We will be opening shortly, so please wait just a little longer. Thank you for your understanding~”  
Customers: “Of course, Ajax!”  
##### -> Ajax gives them a model customer service smile and returns his focus to me.  
Ajax: “Come on, babe. Let’s go inside. There’s still lots to do.”  

*`Scene shifts to Inside Coffee Shop`*  
##### -> Ajax quickly pulls me inside, and as the doors close I hear the customers outside shout a confused “Babe?!”.  
“Hehe, you did that on purpose, didn’t you.”  
Ajax: “Maybe~”  
##### -> We laugh as Ajax pulls me closer.  
Ajax: “I’ve got a special surprise for you.”  
“Oh?”  
##### -> Ajax smirks and leads me over to a nearby counter with two coffee cups.  
“What’s this?”  
Ajax: “This is the very first batch of coffee from Tartelette Roasting Company. I wanted us to experience this momentous occasion together.”  
##### -> Man, this guy never disappoints.  
“I would be delighted to share this moment with you.”  
Ajax: “Perfect~”  

*`Scene shift to CG of Ajax sitting across from MC as they cheers their coffee cups`*  
##### -> Ajax hands me a cup and takes the other for himself.  
“Mmm, smells amazing!”  
Ajax: “Why, thank you~ I brewed it myself.”  
“Then I already know it’s going to taste amazing too.”  
Ajax: “Oh how you flatter me so~”  
##### -> We share a laugh before Ajax gets a more sincere look in his eyes.  
Ajax: With this drink, I wish for a bright future for the both of us~”  
“Together.”  
Ajax: “Together.”  
##### -> With that, we cling our cups together and take our first sips.  
##### -> My body is immediately filled with warmth and bliss.  
##### -> It tastes like new beginnings.
